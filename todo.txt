setup instructions for github actions

script to submit solution from solution1/solution2 files

different s1, s2 files for different languages -> output to output file auto.

setup testing for solution1/solution2 files

stuff to work from .language_choice file

make commands:
-run
-test
-submit1
-submit2

ISSUES:
-extra empty line added at input
-move --- Part Two --- to another line
- add --- Part One --- for p1.txt
-p2 url should be https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/4#part2
-simplify how urls are made
-make the test input from problem text into input_example
-in test framework get the solutions for input_example as test_p1_example and test_p2_example
